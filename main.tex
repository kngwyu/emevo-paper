\begin{abstract}
  The reward system is one of the fundamental drivers for animals to live, motivating behaviors required for survival and reproduction. Despite its importance, the problem of how the reward system has evolved is underexplored. In this paper, we study in what environmental conditions biologically plausible reward functions can evolve. For this purpose, we propose to use a population-based decentralized evolutionary simulation framework, where agents aim to maintain their energy level to live longer and produce more children. Each agent inherits its reward function from its parent and learns to get more rewards via reinforcement learning throughout its lifetime. Our results show that biologically reasonable rewards similar to food pleasure and fatigue evolve from randomly initialized ones. However, at the same time, we find that the reward for taking an action is quite unstable compared to foods rewards. Moreover, we examine the evolution of rewards for poor and poisonous rewards, finding that the evolution of rewards for less important foods tends to be unstable, while rewards for normal foods are still stable.
