\begin{abstract}
  The reward system is one of the fundamental drivers for animals to live, motivating behaviors required for survival and reproduction and serving as objective for reinforcement learning. Despite its importance, the problem of how the reward system has evolved is underexplored. In this paper, we study in what environmental conditions biologically plausible reward functions can evolve. For this purpose, we employ a decentralized evolutionary simulation framework where each agent inherits its reward function from its parent and learns to get more rewards via reinforcement learning throughout its lifetime. Our simulation results show that the evolution of food reward is often unstable under many conditions because the overcosumpition of foods
%by a few agents
  leads to population collapse. We also show that food reward is more stable with the reward functions depending on the agent's nutritional status %regulates food reward
  , suggesting that satiety is required to evolve sustainable food reward.
